📌 Overview
This project is part of my data science learning journey, where I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal was to explore relationships between key features and gain insights into passenger survival trends.

🧠 Objectives
Perform initial data inspection and cleaning

Handle missing values and irrelevant columns

Explore relationships between features

Visualize trends and survival patterns

Gain actionable insights for modeling

📁 Dataset
The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, such as:

Survival status

Age

Sex

Passenger class

Siblings/spouses aboard

Parents/children aboard

Fare paid

Embarkation port

You can download the dataset from Kaggle - Titanic Competition.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

pandas – data handling

numpy – numerical operations

matplotlib and seaborn – data visualization

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Data Cleaning
Removed irrelevant features (Cabin, Ticket, Name)

Handled missing values in Age, Embarked, and Fare

Converted categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) to numerical for analysis

📊 Visualizations
Survival rates by gender and class

Age distribution of survivors vs non-survivors

Correlation heatmap

Fare comparison across classes

Embarkation point impact on survival

📈 Sample Insights
Females had a much higher survival rate than males

1st class passengers were more likely to survive

Younger passengers had slightly better chances of survival

Most passengers embarked from port 'S'

📎 Files
titanic_eda.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing full analysis

titanic.csv: Dataset file (if included)

images/: Folder with generated charts (optional)

✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates the value of EDA in identifying trends and guiding predictive modeling. The Titanic dataset provides a classic example of how demographic and categorical factors influence outcomes in real-world data.
